# Job-interview-workshop
Welcome to the Job Interview Workshop GitHub repository! ðŸŽ“  This repository is a curated collection of resources and problem sets designed to help computer science students, recent graduates, and internship seekers ace technical interviews.
<br><br>
What You'll Find:

    - LeetCode Practice Problems: Carefully selected problems categorized by topic to strengthen your problem-solving skills.
    - Interview Preparation Resources: Tips, guides, and best practices for tackling programming interviews.
    - Coding Topics: Focus on data structures, algorithms, and other key CS fundamentals.
    - Bonus: Soft skills tips to navigate HR interviews and behavioral questions.
<br>
What You Won't Find:

    - Motivation. Even though you will have as much support as I can give you, motivation has to come from within!
    - System Design prep. This is mostly asked in more senior roles, not internships or early career interviews
    - A magic way to get better at data structure and algorithms. It takes, time, effort and patience!
