# Getting Started  

Welcome to the Job Interview Workshop repository! ðŸŽ‰  

This guide provides a structured approach to help you get started with technical interview preparation. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your skills, this collection will point you in the right direction.  

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment  
To practice coding and algorithms, you'll need:  
1. A reliable code editor to play around with (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).  
2. Access to online coding platforms (e.g., [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)).  
3. Version control with [GitHub](https://github.com/) for maintaining your projects and tracking progress(plus version control looks good on your resume!).

## Preffered Language - Python

It's ideal for interview prep due to its simplicity, readability, and robust built-in data structures. It lets you focus on solving problems, not syntax, and write concise, efficient code quickly. If times is of essence(interview coming up soon) then just pick whichever language you're more comfortable with

## Step 2: Understand the Core Concepts  
### Data Structures and Algorithms  
Start by mastering the foundational topics that appear frequently in interviews:  
- Arrays  
- Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees  
- Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Recursion  
- Sorting & Searching  

### Resources to Learn and Practice  
- **NeetCode**: Comprehensive, topic-wise curated with video explanations [neetcode roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). (My favourite resource)
- **LeetCode Study Plan**: Structured programs to master problem-solving on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/study-plan/).  
- **GeeksforGeeks**: Practical explanations and practice problems at [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/).  
- **InterviewBit**: Offers guided preparation tracks: [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/).

### Step 3: Practice Regularly  

Consistency is key when it comes to mastering coding interviews. Aim for steady, daily progress rather than cramming, which can lead to burnout and frustration. Even spending a few minutes reading and understanding problems without solving them is a step forward.  

#### A Proven Strategy for Practicing:  
1. **Start Small**  
   Begin with easier problems to build confidence and strengthen your problem-solving fundamentals. Focus on understanding common patterns in simple algorithms like two-pointer techniques, hashmaps, and basic recursion.  

2. **Mix It Up**  
   Once you're comfortable, introduce medium-level problems to your routine. Alternate between easy and medium problems to keep things challenging without feeling impossible. Avoid getting stuck in your comfort zone or skipping straight to hard problems, as this can be discouraging.  

3. **Target Key Topics**  
   Focus on one topic at a time (e.g., arrays, linked lists, or dynamic programming). Start with a small set of problems for that topic and revisit it regularly.  

4. **Ramp Up Gradually**  
   As you progress, aim for a balance of problem difficulties, ensuring that you're consistently learning but not overwhelmed. For example:  
   - **Week 1**: Solve 5 easy.  
   - **Week 2**: Solve 3 easy, 1 medium  

5. **Reflect and Review**  
   Revisit problems you found challenging to understand alternate approaches or optimize solutions. This step solidifies learning and improves long-term retention.
   If you get stuck in a problem with no solution in sight, look at the answer, understand it and try it again next week.

7. **Simulate Interview Conditions**  
   Use a timer and simulate coding problems as if you were in an interview. Aim for a solution within 30â€“45 minutes to mimic real-world pressure.
   You can also ask friends and peers to give you mock interviews(more on that below).  

#### Suggested Practice Schedule:  
- **Solve 5â€“10 problems per week**: Adjust based on how close your interview is and your availability. If your interview is soon, focus on topics you're less confident in.  
- **Review solved problems**: Read through your own and others' solutions to learn different perspectives and coding techniques.  

### Most importantly, remember that consistent effort over time will yield better results than sporadic bursts of activity. Stick to a plan, and youâ€™ll make steady, meaningful progress! ðŸš€

## Step 4: Prepare for Behavioral Interviews  
Technical skills are only part of the interview process. Resources to prepare for non-technical questions:  
- [Behavioral Questions Cheatsheet by Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/behavioral-questions/)  
- STAR Method for answering: [STAR Interview Method](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method).

## Step 5: Mock Interviews  
Simulate a real interview environment to build confidence:  
- **Pramp**: Free mock interviews with peers - [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/).  
- **Interviewing.io**: Practice live technical interviews with engineers(Paid) - [Interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io/).
